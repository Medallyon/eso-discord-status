If you're using Discord and want to display more than just "Playing [b]Elder Scrolls Online[/b]", this Addon is for you.
By using this Addon, your status on Discord will change to display Rich Presence information, including information about your character, your current location, your party, and more!

This AddOn comes attached with an executable Client, which is necessary to update your status on Discord. It's the same as how [url=http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1245-TamrielTradeCentre.html]Tamriel Trade Centre[/url], for example, handles its data.

Here's a small guide to get the addon working:[list=1][*]Install this addon[*]Start Discord[*]Start ESO[*]Start the Addon Client, found in the Client folder that comes with the Addon[*](Optional) Configure the Addon by typing '﻿﻿[b]/drp[/b]' into the in-game chat[*](Optional) Create a shortcut on your desktop for the Addon Client[/list]

The Addon Client might get flagged by your Anti-Virus program (Windows Defender, Malwarebytes, Avast, etc.). If that's the case, add the program to your exceptions. If you are wary of my program, I completely understand. If you would rather build your own client, visit the [url=https://github.com/Medallyon/eso-discord-rich-presence-client]project repo[/url] and follow the steps there.

If you encounter any issues, please report them on the [url=https://github.com/Medallyon/eso-discord-rich-presence-client/issues]GitHub Repository[/url]. Feel free to fork the project and expand on it if you think you could improve or add to the Addon or the Client.
